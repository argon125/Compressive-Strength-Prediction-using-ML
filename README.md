# Compressive-Strength-Prediction-using-ML
Code done as a part of: 
This experiment was done to predicting the compressive strength of Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete using six different machine learning algorithms: 
1) SVR
2) Random Forest
3) Linear Regressor
4) LASSO regression
5) Ridge Regression
6) ElasticNet

The model was trained on compressive strength data of samples available in literature and experimentally validated with samples generated in the lab.
